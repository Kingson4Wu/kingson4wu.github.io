## 《战争之王》
+ <https://movie.douban.com/review/8808554/>
+ Let me tell you what's gonna happen.This way you can prepare yourself.Soon there's gonna be a knock on that door and you will be called outside. In the hall there will be a man who outranks you.First,he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done, that you're making the world a safer place,that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion.And then he's going to tell you that I am to be released. You're going to protest.You'll probably threaten to resign.But in the end I will be released.The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted.I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile,sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year,sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So , you call me evil. But unfortunately for you,I'm a necessary evil.
　　- 让我告诉你将会发生什么事情，好让你有个心理准备。很快会有人来敲门叫你出去，大厅里有个比你官衔高的人。首先，他会称赞你所做的一切，世界因为你变得更安全，你会获得表扬或晋升。然后他会告诉你，我会被释放。你会反对，也许还威胁要辞职，但最后我还是会被释放。我被释放的理由跟你认为我会被定罪的理由一样，我和世界上称自己为领导人的人打交道。这些人其中有些是你敌人的敌人，世界上最大的军火商是你的老板，美国的总统，他一天卖的比我一年还多，有时候在枪支上找到他的指纹是一件很尴尬的事，有时他需要像我这样的自由工作者供应一些他不方便出面供应的货物。所以，你说我是恶魔，但不幸的是，对你我是一个必须存在的恶魔。
